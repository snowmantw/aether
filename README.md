# Aether: generate Gaia builds

Build a pre-defined vanilla build of calendar with some extra options:

    aether -c calendar/vanilla-build --path /tmp/vanilla-gaia --modules [system, homescreen, browser, calendar]

List how many pre-defined configures are available:

    aether --help presets

Pre-defined settings would be in a specific directory:

    ~/.aether/presets
    ~/.aether/presets/video
    ~/.aether/presets/calendar/vanulla-build.yaml
    # ...
    # and so on
